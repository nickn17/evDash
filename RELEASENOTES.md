# RELEASE NOTES

### V4.0.3 2025-01-11

### V4.0.2 2024-11-11
- New: Automatic detection of service, RX, and TX UUIDs for BLE4 adapters!

### V4.0.0 2024-11-08
!! Note !! This is an initial support release. Known issues include:
- Core2 v1.0: When powered via external CAN, the module does not start. You need to briefly connect USB power, and after disconnecting, it runs fine. Tested for a few months with this configuration.
- Core2 v1.1, CoreS3: Support is not thoroughly tested yet. Basic USB and OBD2 functionality should work. The community will need to help complete other features.
- CoreS3: Using COMMU CAN power with GNSS settings for C2, and connecting USB caused smoke and resulted in a burnt CoreS3. Please proceed with caution and at your own risk.
Changelog: 
- New: M5Stack CoreS3 support
  - LogSerial via HWCDC instead HardwareSerial
  - M5GFX, M5Unified
